# libhoney-rust

Rust library for sending data to Honeycomb.

Rust library for sending events to Honeycomb, a service for debugging your software in
production.

- [Usage and Examples](#usage-and-examples)
- [API Reference][API reference]

## Usage and Examples

### Initialization

Initialize the library by passing in your Team API key and the default dataset name to
which it should send events. When you call the libraryâ€™s initialization routine, it spins
up background threads to handle sending all the events. Once the client goes out of scope,
all background threads will be terminated.

```rust
let client = libhoney::init(libhoney::Config{
  api_key: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  dataset: "honeycomb-rust-example",
});
```

Further configuration options can be found in the [API reference][API reference].
